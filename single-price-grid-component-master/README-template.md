## My process

### Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to make sense of the clamp method to make my fonts more size responsive. 
- How to make conscious choices in how to use the semantics in the HTML, and what type of elements to use. 
- How to write a simple CSS reset in the normalize.css file. 
- What the difference is between the :root and body selector in CSS and have tried to use best practices. 
- A bit better how to use (auto) margins. 
- How to use proper workflow as indicated in the course and proper scoping as indicated in the course. 
- Apparently when specifying the grid-area value you do not use " " marks. 
- How to use CSS selectors such as the > and the *. 


### Continued development

I notice that there is always something to be improved and bettered. I hope to get more aquainted with the different properties and ways of CSS so I can work more practical and quicker. For now I am still nervous about using different types of size units and I know there are a lot of ways in which I can improve my understanding and use of flexbox. In this exercise I did not get to use the wrap value, or any of the flex-item properties.  

### Useful resources

- https://css-generator.netlify.app/box-shadow/ - I used this CSS generator to write my box shadows. 
- Chat GPT - I used to figure out why my grid-area did not work. Apparently when specifying the grid-area value you do not use " " marks.
